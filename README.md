I'm writing a script in R to collate, analyse, and present useful data for performance analysis of organic photo-voltaic devices.
So far I have a small list of goals in mind for this project:
  1. Collate .txt files (DONE)
  2. Make general summaries of the given data (DONE)
  3. Plot J/V curves, with apropiate naming system, of 6 fingers per device, with nth no. devices (OR a given amount by the user).
  4. Decorate these plots with titles, comparable scales, relevant points of interest (origin, x-int, & y-int), the accompanying table for      the plot. 
  5. Arrange the plots into a presentable A4 PDF ordered by device & finger no.
  6. Re-create another A4 PDF with histograms OR accompany the current plots with them.
  7. Build the purpose of this script for it's utility.
